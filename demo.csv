Footnotes:
1,"Source: Statistics Canada, Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)"
2,"All estimates in this table are calculated excluding non-response categories ("refusal", "don't know", and "not stated") in the denominator."
3,"Beginning in 2023, the coverage of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) was changed to include adults aged 18 and older. For estimates based on the total population aged 12 and older, estimates are available in the table <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1310009701" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Health characteristics, annual estimates, by household income quintile and highest level of education (opens new window)</a>."
4,"The household income quintile is based on income received by all household members, from all sources, before taxes and deductions, during the twelve months ending December 31 of the year preceding the interview (for example December 31, 2022 for 2023 estimates). All households are ranked from lowest to highest according to the value of their before-tax income. The ranked population is then divided into five groups of equal numbers of units, called quintiles. This income is adjusted by a low income cutoff which represents the threshold at which a family would typically spend a larger portion of its income than the average family on the necessities of food, shelter and clothing. This adjusted income is divided into five quintiles at the national level (excluding the territories). Quintiles can also be formed at the provincial or health region level comparing these geographies. For more information on household income quintiles, see Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) derived variables documentation. Beginning in 2016, household income data are taken from tax records, if possible."
5,"The highest level of education attained in the households is based on the educational attainments of all household members. Post-secondary includes those with a trade, college, or CEGEP certificate or diploma. Estimates based on the highest level of education exclude non-respondents. As such, totals across the three education categories do not necessarily equal the total across the five income categories."
6,"The confidence interval illustrates the degree of variability associated with a rate. Wide confidence intervals indicate high variability, thus, these rates should be interpreted with due caution. When comparing estimates, it is important to use confidence intervals to determine if differences between values are statistically significant."
7,"Bootstrapping techniques were used to produce the 95% confidence intervals (CIs)."
8,"The following standard symbols are used in this Statistics Canada table: (..) for figures not available for a specific reference period and (...) for figures not applicable."
9,"Percentages are rounded to the nearest tenth. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred."
10,"Census population counts have been used to produce the population projection counts. These counts are used to ensure that the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) survey weights and resulting estimates included in this table are consistent with known population totals."
11,"Quality flags applied to percentage estimates are based on the sample size within the domain of estimation and based on the coefficient of variation (CV) for the estimated number of persons. The flag (E) signifies an estimate with poorer quality which should be used with caution. The flag (F) signifies an estimate with a quality that is too unreliable to be published. When there is no quality flag applied to the data, users should use the estimated confidence intervals as an indicator of quality for the statistics."
12,"Population aged 18 and over who reported perceiving their own health status as being either excellent or very good or fair or poor, depending on the indicator. Perceived health refers to the perception of a person's health in general, either by the person himself or herself, or, in the case of proxy response, by the person responding. Health means not only the absence of disease or injury but also physical, mental and social well-being."
13,"Population aged 18 and over who reported perceiving their own mental health status as being excellent or very good or fair or poor, depending on the indicator. Perceived mental health refers to the perception of a person's mental health in general. Perceived mental health provides a general indication of the population suffering from some form of mental disorder, mental or emotional problems, or distress, not necessarily reflected in perceived health."
14,"Population aged 18 and over who reported perceiving that most days in their life were quite a bit or extremely stressful. Perceived life stress refers to the amount of stress in the person's life, on most days, as perceived by the person or, in the case of proxy response, by the person responding."
15,"Body mass index (BMI) is a method of classifying body weight according to health risk. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Canada guidelines, health risk levels are associated with each of the following BMI categories: normal weight = least health risk; underweight and overweight = increased health risk; obese, class I = high health risk; obese, class II = very high health risk; obese, class III = extremely high health risk."
16,"Body mass index (BMI) is calculated by dividing the respondent's body weight (in kilograms) by their height (in meters) squared."
17,"Body mass index (BMI) is calculated for the population aged 18 and over, excluding pregnant females and persons less than 3 feet (0.914 meters) tall or greater than 6 feet 11 inches (2.108 meters)."
18,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Canada guidelines, the index for body weight classification for the population aged 18 and older is: less than 18.50 (underweight); 18.50 to 24.99 (normal weight); 25.00 to 29.99 (overweight); 30.00 to 34.99 (obese, class I); 35.00 to 39.99 (obese, class II); 40.00 or greater (obese, class III). The population aged 12 to 17 is classified as "severely obese", "obese", or "overweight" according to age and sex specific cut-off points defined by the World Health Organization."
19,"A systematic review of the literature concluded that the use of self-reported data among adults underestimates weight and overestimates height, resulting in lower estimates of obesity than those obtained from measured data. Using data from the 2005 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) subsample, where both measured and self-reported height and weight were collected, BMI correction equations have been developed. This table presents obesity estimates adjusted using these equations."
20,"The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) - Annual, the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) and the 2015 CCHS - Nutrition, all collect height and weight data and derive obesity rates based on Body Mass Index (BMI). Users should take note of the data collection method, the target population and the classification system used by each survey in order to select the appropriate data set."
21,"Population aged 18 and over who reported that they have been diagnosed by a health professional as having arthritis. Arthritis includes osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, but excludes fibromyalgia."
22,"Population aged 18 and over who reported that they have been diagnosed by a health professional as having Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, including females 15 and over who reported that they have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes."
23,"The Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) and the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) - Annual both collect data on high blood pressure. Users should take note of the data collection method and the target population of each survey in order to select the appropriate data set."
24,"Population aged 18 and over who reported that they have been diagnosed by a health professional as having high blood pressure."
25,"Population aged 18 and over who reported that they have been diagnosed by a health professional as having a mood disorder, such as depression, bipolar disorder, mania or dysthymia."
26,"Population aged 18 and over who reported that they have been diagnosed by a health professional as having an anxiety disorder, such as phobia, panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder. Excludes obsessive-compulsive disorder."
27,"Population aged 18 and over who reported being a current smoker. Does not take into account the number of cigarettes smoked."
28,"Data collected for this indicator is based on the question referring to smoking of cigarettes only. Note that data on smoking alternative tobacco products is captured in a different module (TAL)."
29,"Daily smoker refers to those who reported smoking cigarettes every day."
30,"Statistics Canada has two main surveys that produce national and provincial smoking rates. The Canadian Community health Survey(CCHS), and the Canadian Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CTADS), which replaces the Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey (CTUMS) beginning in 2013. Users should be aware of a number of differences between CCHS and CTADS. CCHS collects information from respondents aged 18 and over, CTADS collects information from respondents aged 18 and over; the two surveys use different sampling frames; the annual sample for CTADS is 20,000 compared to 65,000 for CCHS; in CCHS, smoking questions are asked in the context of a wide range of health-related behaviours whereas in CTADS, all questions are related to the use of multiple products and substances with addictive properties. Although these factors can influence the estimates produced at a single point in time, the trends produced by the two surveys have been noted to be very consistent over time. Rather than comparing smoking rates produced from the two surveys, Statistics Canada advises users to choose a single source, based on their objectives, and to use that source consistently."
31,"Occasional smoker refers to those who reported smoking cigarettes occasionally. This includes former daily smokers who now smoke occasionally."
32,"Population aged 18 and over who reported that they have used cannabis in the past 12 months."
33,"Population 18 and over who reported that they have used cannabis daily or almost daily in the past 12 months. The percentage of daily or almost daily cannabis users is calculated out of the full population."
34,"Represents those who have ever tried an e-cigarette/vaping device. Vaping includes vaping e-liquid—with and without nicotine such as flavouring—and using an e-cigarette. Excludes vaping cannabis."
35,"Represents those who have used an e-cigarette/vaping device within the past 30 days. Vaping includes vaping e-liquid—with and without nicotine such as flavouring—and using an e-cigarette. Excludes vaping cannabis."
36,"Heavy drinking refers to males who reported having 5 or more drinks, or women who reported having 4 or more drinks, on one occasion, at least once a month in the past year."
37,"Based on information provided by females aged 18 to 55 who had a baby in the last 5 years."
38,"Initiated breastfeeding refers to mothers who breastfed or tried to breastfeed their last child, or gave breastmilk to their last child even if only for a short time."
39,"Exclusive breastfeeding refers to an infant receiving only breast milk, without any additional liquid (even water) or solid food."
40,"The numerator includes mothers who have exclusively breastfed for at least 6 months and who may or may not be still breastfeeding. The denominator includes all mothers who had a baby in the past 5 years but excludes mothers who were still breastfeeding and who had not introduced any other liquids or solid foods to the baby's feeds."
41,"Indicates the usual number of times (frequency) per day a person reported eating fruits and vegetables. Measure does not take into account the amount consumed. This includes pure fruit juice, frozen or canned fruits and vegetables, and dried fruit, but excludes fried potatoes."
42,"Population aged 18 and over who reported their sense of belonging to their local community as being very strong or somewhat strong. Research shows a high correlation of sense of community-belonging with physical and mental health."
43,"Population aged 18 and over who reported being satisfied or very satisfied with their life in general. Life satisfaction is based on a self-reported score from 0 to 10 for how respondents feel about their life as a whole at the moment. Satisfied or very satisfied represents those who indicated a value of 6 or more out of 10."
44,"Population aged 18 and over who have a health care provider they regularly see or talk to when they need normal care or advice for their health."
45,"Population aged 18 and over who reported having their last influenza immunization (flu shot) in the past 12 months."
46,"This domain is the reference category for the statistical test against other income/education levels."
